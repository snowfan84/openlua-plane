### History ###
I began working on this in January 2018 after discovering the Craft and Theory cables and FlightDeck.  I decided to write my own lua script.
Since then, been adding features and testing - still a work in progress.

Have flown my test plane (FT Sea Duck) out of site and navigated back safely using GUI only!

Enjoy!
